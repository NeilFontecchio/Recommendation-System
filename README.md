# Recommendation-System
Simple Recommendation System


This is a simple recommendation system using a nested dictionary. The initial function "minkowski_distance" finds the euclidean distance between Hailey's ratings and the ratings of all the other people in the dictionary.
After finding the euclidean distance of the different users I sorted the list of tuples and found who had the shortest distance.
Using the user with the shortest distance I was then able to infer what hailey's ratings might be for the movies that she had not watched yet, but her closest match had watched.
